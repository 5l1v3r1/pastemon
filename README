Introduction
------------

pastemon.pl is a script which runs in the background as a daemon and monitors pastebin.com for
interesting content (based on regular expressions). Found information is sent to syslog

The script can also generate (CEF events).

v1.0 - 2012/01/18
-----------------
Initial release

v1.1 - 2012/01/20
-----------------
- Added a '--dump' configuration switch to save matching pasties in a directory.
  This is to keep the pasties posted with an expiration date (example: for later review)

v1.2 - 2012/01/21
-----------------
- Fixed a bug affecting the case sensitivity search
- New feature: an exception can be associated to a regular expression in the configuration file.
  The syntax is: "regex1 _EXCLUDE_ regex2". This could prevent some false positive matches.

v1.3 - 2012/01/26
-----------------
- Added a '--pidfile=file' configuration switch to specify an alternative location for the PID file.
  This allows the script to be executed with a non-root account.
- Added a '--sample=x' configuration to display a sample a data matching a regular expression. 'x' is 
  the number of bytes displayed before and after the matching string. This is useful to estimate the
  value of the pastie.  Example:
  Found in http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Q8pQRHKW : belgium (2 times) | Sample: g(0) ""\n  [32] => string(11) "Belgium(32)"\n  [31] => string(14) "Ne
