History
-------

2012/01/18	v1.0	- Initial release
2012/01/20	v1.1	- Added a '--dump' configuration switch to save matching pasties in
			  a directory. This is to keep the pasties posted with an expiration
			  date (example: for later review)
2012/01/21	v1.2	- Fixed a bug affecting the case sensitivity search
			- New feature: an exception can be associated to a regular expression
			  in the configuration file. The syntax is: "regex1 _EXCLUDE_ regex2" 
			  This could prevent some false positive matches.
